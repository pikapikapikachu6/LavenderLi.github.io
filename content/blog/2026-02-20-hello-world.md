## Why Build a Personal Site?

As a recent Master of Computing graduate, I wanted to build a clean, production-ready personal site to showcase my projects and demonstrate modern front-end engineering practices.

## Tech Stack

I selected a modern front-end stack focused on performance, maintainability, and developer experience:

- **Vite** — Fast bundling and modern ES module support for improved build performance.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first styling system enabling rapid UI iteration with consistent design.
- **React Router** — Client-side routing for structured, scalable navigation.
- **react-markdown** — Content-driven blog architecture with syntax highlighting.

## The Terminal-Style Hero

I wanted the hero section to feel like a developer's terminal. The typing animation reveals lines one by one：

```
$ whoami
Lavender Li
$ cat role.txt
Graduate Software Engineer
```

## What's Next?

Upcoming topics will include:

- Testing strategies and QA methodologies
- Interesting bugs I've encountered and how I solved them
- Project deep-dives and technical walkthroughs

Stay tuned!
